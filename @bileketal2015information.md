## Abstract

Significance
            Social interaction is the likely driver of human brain evolution, critical for health, and underlies phenomena as varied as childhood development, stock market behavior, and much of what is studied in the humanities. However, appropriate experimental methods to study the underlying brain processes are still developing and technically challenging. Here, we extend previous pioneering approaches in neuroimaging (functional MRI (fMRI) hyperscanning) to provide a method for studying information flow between interacting humans in a two-person approach. A scan environment enabling synchronized data acquisition and interaction-based fMRI tasks is described. We provide a generally applicable analysis method to identify interacting brain systems. Specific social brain systems are identified as drivers of interaction in humans, and we find a link to a measure of social expertise.

            Social interactions are fundamental for human behavior, but the quantification of their neural underpinnings remains challenging. Here, we used hyperscanning functional MRI (fMRI) to study information flow between brains of human dyads during real-time social interaction in a joint attention paradigm. In a hardware setup enabling immersive audiovisual interaction of subjects in linked fMRI scanners, we characterize cross-brain connectivity components that are unique to interacting individuals, identifying information flow between the sender’s and receiver’s temporoparietal junction. We replicate these findings in an independent sample and validate our methods by demonstrating that cross-brain connectivity relates to a key real-world measure of social behavior. Together, our findings support a central role of human-specific cortical areas in the brain dynamics of dyadic interactions and provide an approach for the noninvasive examination of the neural basis of healthy and disturbed human social behavior with minimal a priori assumptions.

## Brief Notes
comment:: not 100% clear on the main findings. So this is more a method paper? like hay, i identified this area that is specific to social interaction, so here you go measure??

#### Method:
“hyperscanning functional MRI (fMRI)”

“the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ, component 11, Fig. 2A).”

“The self-report questionnaire social network index (SNI) (22) is a repeatedly used measure describing the complexity and size of the social network a subject is embedded in, and has been found to be related to neural markers such as the volume and function of socially relevant brain regions” (Bilek et al., 2015, p. 5209)

#### Results
“the coupling index proved to be significantly positively associated with the mean social network complexity of real pairs” (Bilek et al., 2015, p. 5209)

## Abstract

Researchers from different backgrounds have an increasing interest in investigating infant cognitive development using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Although EEG measurements are suitable for infants, the method poses several challenges including setting up an infant-friendly, but interference-free lab environment and designing age-appropriate stimuli and paradigms. Certain specifics of infant EEG data have to be considered when deriving event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate cognitive processes in the developing brain. The present article summarizes the practical aspects of conducting ERP research with infants and describes how researchers typically deal with the specific challenges entailed in this work.

* A summary and walk through on procedural details of recording EEG data with infants.
* Event-related potentials (ERPs) are derived from the continuous EEG by averaging multiple EEG segments that are recorded time-locked to certain events, such as visual or auditory stimuli or motor responses.
* ERP is considered a systematic response to the experimental stimulation.

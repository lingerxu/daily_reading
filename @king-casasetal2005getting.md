## Abstract

Using a multiround version of an economic exchange (trust game), we report that **reciprocity expressed by one player strongly predicts future trust expressed by their partner—a behavioral finding mirrored by neural responses in the dorsal striatum**. Here, analyses within and between brains revealed two signals—one encoded by response magnitude, and the other by response timing. Response magnitude correlated with the “intention to trust” on the next play of the game, and the peak of these “intention to trust” responses shifted its time of occurrence by 14 seconds as player reputations developed. This temporal transfer resembles a similar shift of reward prediction errors common to reinforcement learning models, but in the context of a social exchange. These data extend previous model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies into the social domain and broaden our view of the spectrum of functions implemented by the dorsal striatum.

## Brief Notes
comment:: this is more of function brain region paper, instead of social interaction science finding paper, there is neural coupling, bi-directional social relationships; science paper, lots of cites; read, not my fav

#### Main takeaway:
“we report that reciprocity expressed by one player strongly predicts future trust expressed by their partner” (King-Casas et al., 2005, p. 78)

#### Method and Measures:
“Reciprocity is defined as a fractional change in money sent across rounds by one” “player in response to a fractional change in money sent by their partner.” (King-Casas et al., 2005, p. 79)

“we identified a social signal (reciprocity) expressed by the investor that strongly predicted changes in trust by the trustee.” (King-Casas et al., 2005, p. 81)

####  My reading notes:
not my fav, cause the temporal relation is more on the 10-second level, not split second coordination
the whole “ intention to trust“ could be a sequence of emotional response, decision making, etc

#### My remarks on main findings:
so there is no direct prediction or correlation, but participants were grouped into three categories based on behavioral differences, also showed significant brain region differences. But in 2005, the findings are still science-worthy

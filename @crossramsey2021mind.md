## Abstract

As robots advance from the pages and screens of science fiction into our homes, hospitals, and schools, they are poised to take on increasingly social roles. Consequently, the need to understand the mechanisms supporting humanmachine interactions is becoming increasingly pressing. We introduce a framework for studying the cognitive and brain mechanisms that support humanmachine interactions, leveraging advances made in cognitive neuroscience to link different levels of description with relevant theory and methods. We highlight unique features that make this endeavour particularly challenging (and rewarding) for brain and behavioural scientists. Overall, the framework offers a way to study the cognitive science of human–machine interactions that respects the diversity of social machines, individuals’ expectations and experiences, and the structure and function of multiple cognitive and brain systems.

## Brief Notes
**comment**:: This is a very broad paper, I am not sure I am getting this. It seems just ask researchers to broaden the scope theory task (or everything) when it comes to HRI or what is considered social cognition.

## Brief Notes
**comment**:: a well-arounded discussion and review what constitutes social attention and argue for more ecologically valid paradigms for experiments and a dynamic and bi-directional view to study social attention.

### Some of my questions:

> [!question]
> 
> *“This is a critical question because infants’ systematic selection of social information in triadic interactions may not only precede but catalyze their appreciation of shared intentions or common ground”*
> 
> i am not getting what is systematic selection of social information? this selection also changes.

> [!question]
> 
> *“The key point here is that in order to understand how social attention contributes to social understanding,”*
> 
> also, what do you mean by how social attention contributes to social understanding?

## Detailed Notes by Section:
### 2. Development of social attention through the lens of predictive processing
discuss how predictive processing and corrections from errors will result in a more adaptive understanding of the social and physical worlds.
#### 2.1 Learning in response to prediction errors
1. **Predictive processing (PP) by Clark, 2013**
	According to the PP account, the brain does not passively receive and process sensory input. Instead, the brain constantly forms predictions about upcoming inputs and events and dynamically updates internal predictive models based on sensory information (Friston, 2005, 2010).
2. What to do when a prediction error occurs: 
	1. active inference, that is adjusting the world according to internal models through action;
	2. perceptual inference, that is adjusting internal models of the world according to new sensory information.
3. The *violation of expectation* literature
4. They argue that predictive processing is a general learning mechanism, which applies widely to different domains from learning about the physical world to infants’ motor learning as well as their social learning
 
> Human infants possess near endless curiosity and drive to learn and they readily leave their comfort zones in order to explore, for instance when standing up trying to walk after just having mastered crawling or crawling up and down inclined surfaces after just having learned to crawl (Adolph, Bertenthal, Boker, Goldfield, & Gibson, 1997)
-- very interesting view - never thought of that. and as adults, we kinda lost it

> In other words, infants learn to move, but they just as much move in order to learn (Adolph, 2008).

#### 2.2 Implications of predictive processing for social learning
1. The infant learns about the physical world and the social world through others - though I don't know about "more mutually aligned representations of the world" - I mean, we will have education on physics and stuff.
2. Page 9, discusses that “social interactions are fundamentally bidirectional (Beebe & Steele, 2013;Cohn & Tronick, 1988 ).” 
	1. At the same time, the caregiver will also learn about the infant and will improve predicting the infants’ needs and actions (Fotopoulou & Tsakiris, 2017). - very useful and directly related to our paper
	2. "Tracking and understanding these dynamic and bidirectional processes requires taking a second-person perspective (Schilbach et al., 2013) on early social interactions (Hoehl & Markova, 2018;Reddy, 2003 ). "
	3. "Here, the infant is studied as an active participant in mutual and reciprocal exchanges with social partners."
 
> [!important]
> "**The dyad is the unit of observation rather than the individual.**"
> 
> **"We should strive to better understand how dynamical, reciprocal exchanges unfold and lead to changes in the generative models of the infant as well as the caregiver."**
> 
> **"We will discuss why, in our view, social attention should be studied as a bidirectional process of mutual prediction and inference in order to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms through which infants become increasingly proficient social agents and come to co-create shared representations of the world with their caregivers and other people."**
 
### 3. A brief review of current findings and theories of social attention
#### 3.1 Empirical research from a first- or third-person perspective
1. A review on the literature on a) infants preferences for faces b) infants become increasingly more accurate in detecting targets of other people's head and gaze directions
2. However, this lit is not enough because they adopt only the infant's view or from a third person view, not studying the dyad as a system. 
	**In particular, we now know very well when in development infants typically acquire certain social attention skills, but we do not really know how or why they show this developmental progress.**
 
#### 3.2 Illustrative theories for explaining the development of social attention
> [!question]
> 
> what is "*a concept of seeing*" and "*like me mechanism*". 
> 
> "*According to this view, infants link their own first-person experiences with their visual environment to others’ visual experiences,*"?? 
> 
> page 12, section 3.2
1. Notes on some experiments with seeing from close and open eyes? whence the infants learned about this, they decreased gaze following blindfolded person??
2. Tomasellow and Carpenter's shared intentionality account - but no, infants' attention development is really a sensory-motor process that develops everyday, gradually, not phase-like and sudden.
 
#### 3.3 Social attention develops continuously and involves improving mutual prediction
1. "Empirical evidence collected in longitudinal studies on social attention in naturalistic interactions paints a clear picture of continuous development in infancy"
2. "They engage in increasingly complex turn-taking exchanges and they develop routines, for example, giving an object back and forth."
 
> [!important]
> 
> **age-related changes in the observed dyads resulted from a process of mutual adaptation with mothers showing adaptive scaffolding accounting for infants’ growing abilities on the one hand, and infants developing increasingly sophisticated social attention skills benefitting from the opportunities offered by their mothers on the other hand**
> 

> [!important]
> Also I need to look over my results and incorperate this "interpersonal eye-hand coupling (i.e., visual attention to the interaction partner’s object manipulations) goes along with higher levels of joint visual attention as well as more frequent mutual switches of visual attention in 1-year-old infants and their caregivers (Yu & Smith, 2013, 2017)."

### 4. Studying social behavior at finer spatial and temporal scales
#### 4.1 Time scales of human behavior
1. "If we are to more fully understand the processes by which social attention contributes to social understanding then we need to study this phenomenon as a dynamical system." HOW?? PLEASE HELP ME ANSWER THIS
2. "By definition, a dynamical system is high-dimensional, multi-level and multi-causal, and nonlinear (Bertenthal, 2007;Thelen & Smith, 2008 )."
3. "What has been lacking in existing studies is **a way of modeling how behavior is dynamic and multi-causal and especially how it unfolds over multiple time scales**."
4. "The key feature of these studies is that real-time communication occurs in such a way that participants experience mutual engagement with their partners (Redcay & Schilbach, 2019)."
 
#### 4.2 Eye tracking during social interaction
1. This went on to review Yu & Smith work on dual eye-tracking
2. "In particular, this methodology sacrifices the spatial and temporal resolution" because eye gaze was not studies in terms of fixations and saccards, but just the total durations.
3. Read [[@tatleretal2017latest]]
4. “Fixation durations were tested as a function of age, gaze direction (toward or away from the viewer), and action type (actions involved either manipulating an object—object-directed—or holding and waving an object—infant-directed).” in [[@boyeretal2020temporal]] - need to read and understand what is this mean dwell time

#### 4.3 Neural oscillations and synchrony during social interaction
1.

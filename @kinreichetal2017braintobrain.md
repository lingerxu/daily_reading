* paper measured EEG brain-to-brain synchrony in male-female dyadic naturalistic interactions, where neural synchrony was found for couples not strangers and neural synchrony was linked with behavioral synchrony.

#### Main AIM/contribution:
“the goal of the current study was to examine whether natural social moments induce linked EEG activations betw” (Kinreich et al., 2017, p. 1)

“Our findings link brain-to-brain synchrony to the degree of social connectedness among interacting partners, ground neural synchrony in **key nonverbal social behaviors**, and highlight the role of human attachment in providing a template for two-brain coordination.”
